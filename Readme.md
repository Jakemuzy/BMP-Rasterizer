<h2>This Application comes with custom features fully implemented by myself, no outside libraries</h2>  

1.) Allows creation and modification of bmp files  
2.) Displays the bmp file updating every frame 
3.) Allows for the projection of 3d points onto the 2d screen space that is the bmp file 
4.) Supports double buffer rendering for better animated experience  
5.) Supports linearly interpolation between points to fill in both the colors and pixels in between vertices in a triangle  
6.) Utilizes frame buffer and depth buffer for better performance
  
Through this application I have created essentially an animation of a spinning cube
